# if-else-condition-in-python   

Practice if /else condition in python.Here there are many ways of doing one code in several ways .Here i have done practis of if and else condition .If someone is a new learner can learn from my codes .I had explained every code in detail.Feel free to ask your doubts but do not make any changes in the code .

# w1d1 -ct Question down here , here T = task 

T-1 . WAP to prompt input from user to enter their name and print "Hello{username}, Congratulations on your first python program!!

T-2 . WAP to prompt user to enter 2 numbers(dividend and divisor), print the Quotient. 

T-3 . WAP to collect the below details about a user, using the input prompt.

T-4 . WAP that calculates the area of a rectangle. Prompt the user to enter the length and width, and then use arithmetic operators to compute the area.

T-5 . WAP to increment a number by 1 using the unary + operator.

# w1d2 -ct == if_else_practice_Question(file) 
Here is a separate set of practice questions for if/else conditions.
Here the question are in the file only .

# w1d1 -HT == if_else_p_2 
T-1 . Write a Python program to calculate the area of a circle with a given radius using only arithmetic operators.
Note: Area of circle = 3.14 * raduis ** 2

T-2 . Write a Python program that calculates the power of a number. Ask the user for the base and exponent, and display the result.

T-3 . Write a Python program to calculate the remainder of division between two numbers. Prompt the user to enter two integers and display the remainder of their division.

T-4 . Write a Python program that demonstrates the use of the type() function to check the data type of a variable. Prompt the user to enter a value, and then print its data type.

T-5 . Write the Python program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

# w1d2 - HT == W1D2_HT
